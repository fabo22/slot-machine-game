/* Psuedocode:
This program will display a slot machine with multiple buttons that a user can click. 
IF the Spin button is clicked by the user, the slots will 'spin' and each slot will display a randomized image. 
IF all three images are the same, the user will receive a certain amount of 'Tokens' depending on the value of the image they matched. 
IF none of the image values match, the user will lose a token.
IF the user has lost all their tokens, a message will appear stating they have gone Bankrupt and a Play Again button will apear
IF the user clicks the Play Again button, the program will run again from the beginning
